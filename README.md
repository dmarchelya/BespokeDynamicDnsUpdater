It runs on Windows and is written in C# and is built on the .NET Framework 4.

DNS-O-Matic is a service that enables you to install a single updater client on your computer, and update hostnames at one or more of the [dozens](http://www.dnsomatic.com/wiki/supportedservices) of dynamic dns providers that DNS-O-Matic supports.

**NEW!** Bespoke Dynamic DNS Updater now supports [Amazon Route53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [Dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com/r/06e6b21976c5b9).  The Windows installer has been rewritten and now includes the ability to configure these services during installation.

A Windows Installer is available on GitHub ([Github Downloads](https://github.com/dmarchelya/BespokeDynamicDnsUpdater/downloads)).  This is the best place to download the installer without having to compile source code.
